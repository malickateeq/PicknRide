    <h4 style="padding: 30px;" class="two-sec-text">PicknDrop is the high-tech pick and drop service which has been created 
        for the sole purpose of facilitating people who need to commute to work, 
        College, or University regularly. Pick drop shuttle service is one of a 
        kind service which offers the user with optimal suggestion, notification
        services, and comfort on the go! We encourage the user to use this 
        service as it would reduce both road congestion and energy consumption. 
        The goal is to provide people with such a clean and affordable service 
        so that it brings a shift in the trend of using private cars towards 
        people opting more for our shuttle service.</h4>
